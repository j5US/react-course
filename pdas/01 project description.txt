This is a very basic project based on React. 
The main motive of this project is to understand the usecases of props in custom JSX components.
This is the first react project that used the
bulma library.

-> bulma was installed locally using the command: npm i bulma

-> it was added using: import "bulma/css/bulma.css";

-> also by default the styling was in dark mode: 
            to disable darmode: add attribute: data-theme="light" to the html tag.
